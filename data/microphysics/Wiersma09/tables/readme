The archive contains files that give net cooling rates due to various
elements as a function of density, temperature, and redshift. Each
file is encoded using the HDF5 format
(http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5/).

For a description of the methods used, see 

Wiersma, R. P. C., Schaye, J., and Smith, B. D. 2009, MNRAS, 393, 99

The gas was exposed to the (redshift-dependent) Haardt & Madau (2001,
hereafter HM01) UV/X-ray background from quasars and galaxies and the
(redshift-dependent) cosmic microwave background (CMB). The gas was
assumed to be optically thin and in ionization equilibrium.

The redshift range is identical to that of the HM01 model: z = 0
through z = 8.989. Every file is named for the redshift it represents,
with the exception of the following files:

-z_8.989nocompton.hdf5: This file contains net cooling rates for the z
       = 8.989 UV/X-ray background, but without the CMB. Such a table
       could be used in a pre z=9, but post-reionization universe (one
       should then add redshift-dependent Compton cooling off the CMB
       analytically).

-z_photodis.hdf5: This file contains net cooling rates computed using
       a soft, non-ionizing UV background. It was computed for the z =
       8.989 HM01 background but with the spectrum cut-off at 1
       Ryd. The CMB was not included. This background dissociates
       molecules, but does not contain H-ionizing radiation. It could
       for example be used in the pre-reionization universe (one
       should then add redshift-dependent Compton cooling off the CMB
       analytically).

In addition, we provide the following redshift-independent file:

-z_collis.hdf5: This file contains net cooling rates computed assuming
       collisional ionization equilbrium and no CMB. Note that 'no induced 
       processes' was not used in this table (all other tables were made with 
       this command) since it caused cloudy to crash.

Each file contains groups corresponding to the different elements
(e.g., "/Carbon"). Hydrogen and helium are considered simultaneously
in the group "/Metal_free". The different contributions to the cooling
rates can be combined and scaled to the desired abundances as
described in WSS08 (eq. 3).

All metals (not just the ones we do separately) are considered
simultaneously in the group "/Total_Metals". This latter table is useful if
the metallicity is known, but not the abundances of individual
elements.  The metal and H&He contributions to the cooling rates can
be combined and scaled to the desired metallicity as described in
WSS08 (eq. 4).

The group "/Header" contains some useful meta-data and the group
"/Solar" considers all elements simultaneously (assuming solar
abundances).

The tables were prepared using the Haardt and Madau (2001) quasars and
galaxies spectrum, and CLOUDY (last described in Ferland et al. 1998)
version 07.02. 

The ranges of the tables are as follows:
Temperature: 100 K - 9.1612998e8 K
Hydrogen density: 1 cm^-3 - 1e-8 cm^-3
Redshift: 0 - 8.989
Helium mass fraction (Helium number ratio): 0.238 - 0.298 (0.07865282 - 
0.10689845)
Energy density: 1e10 erg/g - 1e18 erg/g

Our website (http://www.strw.leidenuniv.nl/WSS08/) contains many sample 
scripts to give an idea as to how to use the tables
