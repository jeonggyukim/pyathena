This package contains UV/X-ray background (UVB) model data in electronic form from the paper
"A Cosmic UV/X-ray Background Model Update" by C.-A. Faucher-Giguere
(https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08657).

NB regarding FG19 vs. FG20. The FG20 model corresponds to the model version published by MNRAS
and is the recommended version. The FG19 is a similar model, which was described in v1 of the arXiv
preprint at https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08657. The FG20 version improves upon FG19 by using the
Shen et al. (2020) AGN luminosity function, an improved AGN spectral treatment, and an improved
model for the IGM column density distribution. The FG19 model is provided here only as a reference
for studies which may have used FG19 before FG20 became available. For updates on the FG UVB models,

Two types of files are provided and identified by the file names:

 - *_treecool_*.dat: Photoionization rates and photoheating rates in a table that can be
                     directly used with the GADGET, GIZMO, and Arepo codes (possibly others).

                     Simply replace the file TREECOOL in your code directory to use the model
                     in a simulation.

                     Files ending '_thin.dat' correspond to rates computed directly from a
                     UVB model obtained by solving the cosmological radiative transfer
                     equation for a spatially-homogeneous UVB (incorrect assumption prior to
                     reionization).

                     Files ending in '_eff_*.dat' correspond to modified TREECOOL files that
                     use "effective" photoionization and photoheating rates prior to
                     reionization (see the paper for details).

                     The 'fg20_treecool_eff_default.dat' file corresponds to the
                     fiducial FG20 UVB model with the default reionization history parameters
                     used in the paper.

                     *RECOMMENDED* The 'fg20_treecool_eff_rescaled_heating_rates_068.dat' file
                     is the same fiducial FG20 UVB model with effective heating rates to model
                     reionization events, but with all the photoheating rates (HI, HeI, and HeII)
                     rescaled by a factor of 0.68. This is to match the "rescaled" FG20 model
                     shown in Gaikwad et al. (2020; https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00016) to result
                     in a better match to the measured temperature evolution of the IGM at z>=2.

                     We thank Prakash Gaikwad and collaborators for calibrating these rescaled
                     heating rates to the empirical measurements.

                     The columns in TREECOOL files are:

  log(1+z), Gamma_HI, Gamma_HeI, Gamma_HeII, qdot_HI, qdot_HeI, qdot_HeII

  where 'Gamma' is a photoionization rate and 'qdot' is a photoheating rate.

  The Gamma's are in units of s^-1, and the qdot's are in units of erg s^-1.

 - *_spec_lambda.dat: Full UVB spectrum as a function of wavelength and redshift. Same ASCII
                      file format as used to distribute the HM12 UVB model
                      (see http://www.ucolick.org/~pmadau/CUBA/DOWNLOADS.html).


  line 1 contains fields identifying the sampling redshifts, from 0 to 10.

  lines 2 through [end of file]: the first field in each column is the rest-frame wavelength
  in Angstroms and fields 2 through [end of line] give the background intensity J in units of
  ergs/s/cm^2/Hz/sr at the different sampling redshifts.

  - *_spec_nu.dat: Similar format as *_spec_lambda.dat, but frequencies in unit of Ry instead
                   of wavelengths in A, and spectrum J in units of 10^-21 ergs/s/cm^2/Hz/sr.

  - fg20_cloudy.ascii: Full UVB spectrum vs. wavelength and redshift, in a format that can
                       be directly used by the Cloudy photoionization code
                       (https://trac.nublado.org).

                       The first 10 lines are meta-data, which identify e.g. the code
                       version and specify the number of redshifts (line 5) and
                       wavelengths (line 6) for which the UVB spectrum is tabulated.

                       Line 11 is the line of redshifts sampled
                       Line 12 is the line of wavelengths sampled

                       Each subsequent line lists Jnu (in ergs/s/cm^2/Hz/sr) for a redshift
                       (in the order of line 11) and for the wavelengths sampled (in the
                       order of line 12).

                       This file is formatted such that this it can replace the HM12 model
                       in Cloudy. I.e., if you replace the Cloudy data file
                       'hm12_galaxy.ascii' in Cloudy's 'data' subdirectory with this
                       file, then the commands normally employed to use the HM12 model
                       in Cloudy will instead use the FG20 model.

                       NB: The first line contains a date in the numerical format YYYYMMDD,
                       e.g. 20060612.' This must match the date expected by Cloudy, which
                       may differ depending on the Cloudy version you are used. If you get an
                       error, replace the first line in fg20_cloudy.ascii by the date at the
                       top of your hm12_galaxy.ascii file.

                       This is provided for convenience until a separate command to use
                       the FG20 model is added to Cloudy.



The full spectrum files are only provided for the background models computed in the
homogeneous approximation (there are no 'effective' spectra defined before reionization).
